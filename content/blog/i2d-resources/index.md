this is a personal collection of resources for the inochi2d set of software that includes inochi session and inochi creator. most, if not all of these resources were originally posted in the inochi2d discord server and most recently gathered together through an effort by Licore et. al. thanks a lot!

please be aware that these resources are relevant as of the date of this blog post, 18 February 2024 and may not reflect the most up-to-date i2d software.

## how do i...?

### open inochi creator on macOS?

as of 0.8.3, inochi creator needs some manual massaging to open on macOS. please refer to the following steps in order to get creator to see SDL2 properly.

1. Right click Inochi Creator, Show package contents
2. navigate to Contents/Frameworks
3. rename `libSDL2-2.0.dylib` to `libSDL2.dylib` 
(via Luna)

### work with flip pairings?
{{% aside %}}
a flip pairing is a configuration of parts that are generally the left nd right of a given rig. for example, i might have a part named `Eye::Left` and create a flip pairing with its counterpart `Eye::Right`.

#### [copy and paste a mesh to use with other parts?](https://discord.com/channels/855173611409506334/888154799357440030/1080316944495943790)
discord link

if you would like to copy a mesh that you've already created from one node to another node, switch to your target node and then drag the name of the node from the nodes menu onto the Edit Mesh button. the buttons should then change into "Copy Mesh" and you can drop the mesh onto the button to copy it.

#### [copy a rig to its symmetrical counterpart?](https://discord.com/channels/855173611409506334/888154799357440030/1128340725025738813)
(eg left eye to right eye blink) - discord link
seagetch shows how to copy a rigged right eye parameter to Ada's left eye.

#### create flip pairings?
TODO

### export video
#### export video from inochi creator?
[install ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) 
if you've created an animation in inochi creator and would like to export a video of it directly, you'll need to install ffmpeg. the export animation menu entry will be disabled otherwise. 

### use the path deform tool?
#### [use the path deform tool?](https://youtu.be/gPMdlKGLELE?si=9OGjWKNJektpooEC)
Inochi2D Physics and Path Deform by Horns for Eyes shows you how to use both the path deform tool and the physics engine in inochi creator.

### use physics?
#### rig physics?
see above video

### use expression bindings?

#### [inochi session wiki](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-session/wiki)
not too user-friendly but if you know a bit of lua and how math works, you'll probably understand this pretty quickly.

#### [expresison bindings test model by navy prince](https://ko-fi.com/s/7a25339fbe)
this includes both an inp and inx file to play with.

#### [expression binding notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Xsjy5mZml6OIpqDdt9xfz32onw2OsO2bwTv_smuH8Y/edit)
