A while back my partner came up to me and asked if I thought I would want to come up with a design for a vtuber idea she had. I thought it was an interesting prospect so I said "sure" and set about jotting some initial concepts down.

## initial sketches

This and the following sections will be rather brief since I mainly want to cover the meat and potatoes of the project, but I digress.I received a helpful google doc with some loose goals and descriptions of our mysterious vtuber. The doc included ideas for her clothes and hair, and specified that she should based off a luna moth.  

## inspiration

I then trawled the internet for inspiration. Along the way, I grabbed some references of luna moths. To be fair, I was planning on keeping the new character design pretty light on moth, so I asked if that was ok. Once I got the go-ahead, I began thinking about what elements of the luna moth I wanted to convvey through the character design. 

## colors

The original spec had included a color palette and I will be honest, I wasn't a fan. Since I'm picky I decided to come up with alternate palettes. We got together one evening and went through our favorite combinations and ideas from the rough color drafts we both drew up.

## base sketch

Here, we're almost at where it truly begins. I used an example model from Inochi2d as a canvas size reference. Then I used Clip Studio Paint's ruler tool to place a line of symmetry down the middle of the canvas and got to work. It was actually pretty chill and fun!

## separaating into parts

this was truly agonizing i hate using my brain for things

I was almost done here and yet my brain was almost too fried to even draw the hands and neck section of the scarf.

After one agaonizing day of "thinking" I had finished using "logic" to separaate out all the layers of the vtuber puppet. The next step was to paint and render each layer while trying to make the whole thing look cohesive.

I started to draw the shapes beginning from the ones closest to the background, working my way up to the front. This helped me out in a couple of different way. It helped ease me into the process since the background shapes tended to be more simple, and it also helped me not lose track of what I was working on at any given time (even if I kept forgetting to name the layers. But to be fair, CSP doesn't make it that smooth of a process). 

But then... the face. I had finally come to the most complex part of the separaation process. Once again, I turned to the trust example model that I had previously taken a peek at. *Weeeell* for the lips and mouth sections anyway. I just yolo'd it for the eyes. Good luck, future me! The mouth bits were kind of interesting. Every other part up until then easily covered all of the parts below it in a sort of... "self-contained" fashion. Even the single items I had to split into parts to account for the joints didn't require much thinking. A mouth sits on top of the face because the lips define where it starts, but then it begins to recede towards the back of the head. This meant I had to draw a weird mouth sandwich, starting from the inside of the mouth, finishing with a weird donut shape to 1) account for the lips and 2) cover up the rather large shape I made for the inner part of the mouth ~~(I made it this way to account for "big" facial expresssions, but maybe there's a better way).~~ *future me here: i learned that i didn't need to do this after playing around in inochi 2d a bit*

Eventually I finished doing some "rough" outlines.

## coloring

the first time I tried coloring was just me flood filling all the outlines i had drawn because I really thought I could just paint over everything and things would be definitely okay but it made the mental burden larger and that sucked so i started over and made folders with a proper lineart and color layer more reminiscient of how I work on a more typical piece aaaaaaa. 

I made some minor edits along the way. The inner mouth I initally drew was too big, which made it harder to color in the rest of the face and lips. I was also careful to not worry about whether parts looked like they flowed into each other, at least for the moment. Making sure I was satisfied with how general idea came across was more important and if I had focused on the seamless stitching of parts together at this stage, any changes I would want to do later would require redoing the seams as well. 

At some point through coloring, I started to really get tired of looking at this file. Every second that I stared at it made things look more and more wrong, or weird, or incorrect. I took a break to work on some other stuff, hoping to come back refreshed. There were no real deadlines for this project but it was still something that I promised to finish for someone else so I really needed to pace myself to avoid getting burnt out buuuut I also have a tendency of abandoning projects if they go on too long unfinished. I'm determined to not let that happen in this case. At the very least, making something that's important to my partner should light a fire under my butt, in theory.
